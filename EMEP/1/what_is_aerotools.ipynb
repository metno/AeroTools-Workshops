    "- Reading data\n",
    "    - Model data is read from gridded data (mostly netCDF). If the data file(s) is Aerocom compliant and the variables you want to use are registered in PyAerocom, then PyAerocom should be able to read the file(s).\n",
    "    - Observations can be both gridded data (e.g. satellite data) and ungridded data (most observational networks). Ungridded data is generally difficult to read, as each observational network has its own file format. PyAerocom has built in several readers for different observational networks. At the start of 2024, PyAerocom has started to use [Pyaro](https://github.com/metno/pyaro), which is a separate MET project meant to make it easier to write your own ungridded data reader, without having to mess with the source code of PyAerocom. We will in another tutorial see how to use Pyaro when reading data (but not how to make a reader, for that see the [Pyaro documentation](https://pyaro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "    - Ungridded data can be seen as a collection of StationData objects. These are objects holding timeseries of observations, as well as metadata, for separate measurement stations.\n",
    "    - The classes for reading data will return either a *GriddedData* or a *UngriddedData* objects (as well as *StationData* objects coming from the UngriddedData objects. These can be used on there own, without the need for colocation.\n",
    "- Pre- and post-processing can be done on the data before and after reading, as well as before and after colocation. This include excluding and filtering measurement stations, filtering measurements, as well as calculate timeseries for coarser measurement frequencies (e.g. going from daily to monthly timeseries)\n",
    "- Colocation is the final step of PyAerocom, and consists of matching model data with observations\n",
    "    - The most common way of colocation in Gridded-Ungridded colocation, where gridded model data is matched with ungridded observational data. In this case gridded model data is interpolated to the position (and time) of the measurements done at a station, so that the model and observation can be compared.\n",
    "    - The newest feature of PyAerocom is the ability to colocate vertical profiles.\n",
    " \n",
    "As mentioned above, the final result of PyAerocom is a *ColocatedData* object. This can used on its own, e.g. for plotting of user defined analysis."
