    "\n",
    "- **PyAerocom**: The largest part of AeroTools. Handles reading data, colocating data, and pre- and post-processing. The main output is a ColocatedData object.\n",

    "\n",

    "### PyAerocom\n",
    "\n",
    "PyAerocom is the core of AeroTools. It is used as a standard Python library, by calling classes and methods directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyAerocom is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading data**\n",
    "    - Model data is read from gridded files (mostly netCDF). If the files are Aerocom-compliant and the variables are registered in PyAerocom, it should be able to read them.\n",
    "    - Observations can be gridded (e.g., satellite data) or ungridded (most observational networks). Ungridded data is often difficult to read, as each network has its own format. PyAerocom includes several readers for different networks. Since early 2024, PyAerocom uses [Pyaro](https://github.com/metno/pyaro), a separate MET project that makes it easier to write your own ungridded data reader without modifying PyAerocom’s source code. Another tutorial will show how to use Pyaro for reading data (see the [Pyaro documentation](https://pyaro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for writing readers).\n",
    "    - Ungridded data is represented as collections of StationData objects, which hold timeseries and metadata for individual stations.\n",
    "    - Data reading classes return either *GriddedData* or *UngriddedData* objects (and *StationData* objects from UngriddedData). These can be used independently, without colocation.\n",
    "- **Pre- and post-processing** can be performed before and after reading, as well as before and after colocation. This includes filtering stations, filtering measurements, and calculating timeseries for coarser frequencies (e.g., converting daily to monthly timeseries).\n",
    "- **Colocation** is the final step, matching model data with observations.\n",
    "    - The most common colocation is Gridded-Ungridded, where gridded model data is interpolated to the location and time of station measurements for comparison.\n",
    "    - PyAerocom now also supports colocation of vertical profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of PyAerocom is a *ColocatedData* object, which can be used for custom analysis and plotting."
